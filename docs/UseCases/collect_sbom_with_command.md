# Command containing SBOM puts SBOM in PACE

This is a PCS use case where a decision-maker (outside PACE)
gives PACE (the PAR component of PACE is particular)
an SBOM.

The PAR can only be written to by the PCS and the PES.
In this case, it is the PCS that receives the command
from the decision-maker and writes to the PAR.
