## Introduction
This is for answering frequently asked questions (FAQ)
about PACE.
Initially it will just a random list of questions
that we will organize later

## What is PACE?
Need something pithy here with a reference link to something more complete

## Is PACE and open source or standards effort?
Good question.
The objective is to meet the OCA goal of
"making standards-based interoperable cybersecurity".
The plan to achieve that goal wrt PACE is to
have one or more open source reference implementations
and to define the interfaces,
which would eventually be standardized.

## How does PACE relate to OCA?
PACE is a subproject of OCA just like Stixshifter and Kestrel.

## How does CACAO relate to PACE?
[Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cacao/security-playbooks/v1.0/security-playbooks-v1.0.html)
(CACAO) playbooks contain decision points and actions to be taken.
Many of the decision points will use security posture,
i.e. PACE data,
to decide on the course of action.

## How does PACE relate to the Security Content

## How does PACE relate to the Situational Awareness Reference Architecture (SARA)?
The
[Situational Awareness Reference Architecture](http://ics-isac.org/sara/)
(SARA) was created by the ICS-ISAC "for industrial facility owners and operators as an open source guide to establishing and maintaining situational awareness." They break SARA into 4 components:
- Identity
- Inventory
- Activity
- Sharing

PACE is for collecting and evaluating security posture attributes.
PACE can serve as part of SARA sharing -
i.e. SARA can create security posture attributes
to be collected by PACE.
In addition security posture provided by PACE
can be input to SARA.
